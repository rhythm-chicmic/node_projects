This repository provides a foundation for understanding Node.js development and establishing a well-organized project structure for your Node.js projects.

What You'll Learn:

Core concepts of Node.js, including its event-driven architecture and asynchronous nature.
Essential modules and libraries used in Node.js development.
Best practices for writing clean and maintainable Node.js code.
Project Structure:

This repository utilizes a common structure for Node.js projects:

node-basics/
├── README.md (This file you're reading)
├── package.json (Project dependencies and scripts)
├── src/       (Source code directory)
│   ├── index.js (Main application entry point)
│   ├── utils/  (Utility functions)
│   └── ...      (Additional source code folders)
├── .env       (Environment variables for development)
├── .gitignore (Files to exclude from version control)
└── tests/     (Unit tests for your application)
Explanation:

package.json: This file manages project dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.
src/: This directory contains your application's source code.
index.js: The main entry point for your Node.js application.
utils/: A directory for commonly used functions or modules.
.env: This file stores environment variables for development purposes (excluded from Git by default).
.gitignore: This file specifies files to be ignored by Git version control.
tests/: This directory houses your unit tests to ensure code functionality.
Getting Started:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-basics.git
Install dependencies: npm install
Run the application (assuming index.js is your entry point): node src/index.js
