# Node.js Basics Repository

This repository provides a foundation for understanding Node.js and setting up well-structured Node.js projects.

## Getting Started with Node.js

### Prerequisites:

- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, WebStorm)
- Node.js and npm installed (<https://nodejs.org/>)

### Learning Resources:

- Official Node.js Documentation: <https://nodejs.org/en/docs/>
- Node.js School Interactive Tutorial: <https://www.nodeschool.io/>

## Project Structure

A common structure for Node.js projects helps maintain code organization and collaboration. Here's a suggested layout:


- **package.json**: This file stores project metadata, dependencies, and scripts. Use `npm init` to create it.
- **src/**: This directory holds your application's source code.
  - **index.js**: Typically the main entry point for your Node.js application.
- **Additional Subdirectories**: Organize your code further by creating subdirectories for specific functionalities or modules.
- **.gitignore**: This file specifies files and patterns to exclude from version control using Git.
- **Optional Files**: You may include additional configuration files depending on your project's needs (e.g., `.env`, for environment variables).
